I have uploaded the data sets used in this project, in the repository.

In SAP Predictive Analytics, First of all I have added Sales Trasaction file and then I have merged this data with the master data
using left Join on Material file. Similarly I have joined Customer data, Product Category data, Sales Organization Data, and Month data to 
the Transactional Data so that we can dig deeper into data.

Once we have have acquired and merged sales transaction data with master data, We can manipulate and Visualize the data.

I have deleted all measures except – Discount, Revenue , Sales Price, SalesQuantity, and Transfer Price. I have also added a calculated
column Net Sales using formula {Revenue} – {Discount}, and have created this new attribute as a Measure.

I have also created a Geographic hierarchy by names, and resolved all the unresolved Countries, cities and regions in the hierarchy.

Finally I have visualized the data to find answers to the following questions

1. What Year had the highest revenue? What was the revenue?
2. What material (with name) had the highest revenue? What was the revenue? 
3. Are the historical (year by year) revenue trends for the US and DE (Germany) similar or dissimilar? 
4. Did GBI ever gain or lose a customer? Explain 
5. Is there seasonality in revenue during the year? If so, what month has the highest revenue? Is the seasonality similar from year to year?
6. In 2011, for what Material did the highest Revenue from a single customer occur? 
7. Are there any products that show dramatic change in revenue over time (years)? Does it have similar change by country? 
8. Is there any material that does not display significant seasonality? 
9. What customer has the highest percentage contribution to revenues? What has been the trend of that customer’s percentage contribution over the years? 
10. Which region has the highest revenue?
